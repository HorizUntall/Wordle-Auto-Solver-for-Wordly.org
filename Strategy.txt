Strategy:

Pre-requisites: 
* Identify how many letters for the problem
* Get a word list that has n letters (Focus on 5)

1. Input a random strategic word (must have non-repeating letters)
	* Then see which (letter) is correct and in the right position (correct letters) and which is correct and not in the right position (misplaced letters)
	* Filter in the entire list of words that has the correct letters in a specific position and contains the misplaced letters
	* Identify the letters that are both incorrect and not in the right direction (incorrect letters)
	* Filter out the entire list of words that have the incorrect letters
	* Filter out the entire list of words that has the misplaced letters in the wrong direction

	note: for each letter in the input, their positions must be recorded

	Potential problem: Correct answer is not in the list

	Current way of filtering: Going through all the list, checking by the conditions; (I think it's O(n), which could be inefficient)

2. If all letters are incorrect, do the step one

3. If after all the filtering,  one word is left in the list, then choose that.

4. If after all the filtering, 2 words are left in the list, then choose which one is more popular (if the words are sequenced/sorted in terms of popularity). Then if wrong, choose the other one.

5. If after all the filtering, there are more than 2 words left in the list, do step one

6. After all the filters, then there is no word left, then say that the program couldn't solve it
